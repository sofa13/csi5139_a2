# CSI 5139 Assignment 2

This assignment explores the Keras API with tensorï¬‚ow backend. We will use the Extended Outex texture dataset from the University of Oulu and LAGISFRE CNRS. We will train CNN architectures such as MLP, LeNet-5 and VGG-16 for multi texture classification. We will conclude with an attempted t-SNE visualization of the input training images.
